- `src/schema.sql`, `src/Config/Database.php`, `src/Services/VettingPurger.php`, `public/admin/index.php`, `public/admin/edit-business.php`, `public/api/businesses.php`: separated immutable unique `business_id` (`BBIZ-XXXXXXXX`) from dynamic sequential `business_number` (`1..N`), automatically incrementing on add and decrementing/renumbering with zero gaps on delete (closes #31)

- `public/assets/vendor/leaflet/`, `public/assets/js/directory.js`, `public/index.php`: replaced the synthetic SVG grid with a real interactive Leaflet + OpenStreetMap map displaying streets, features, neighborhoods, and place names alongside custom Busherian pins (closes #23)
